# Protocol Summary

The protocol is based on the hindufestival of Dussehra where Lord Rama killed Ravana as a symbolism of victory of good over evil. The protocol presents it as a game where we can choose our ram , mint that NFT of our Ram and eventually kill Ravana. The protocol demontrates it in a gamify way with the help of smart contracts.

# Findings :

### [L-1]  We are using transient nonRentrant which can be risky

**Description** The `InheritanceManager::nonReentrant` modifier is using transient storage which can be risky

```javascript
modifier nonReentrant() {
        assembly {
            if tload(1) { revert(0, 0) }
-->            tstore(0, 1)
        }
        _;
        assembly {
-->            tstore(0, 0)
        }
    }
```

**Impact** It can be risky(although gas effeceint) but as transient storage is cleared only after the end of transaction, not at the end of the call!!!

**Recommended mitigation** Use Reentrancy Guard inatead of transient storage.

### [H-1] No Zero Address & Self Address check in `InheritanceManager::sendEth()` function 

**Description** In `InheritanceManager::sendEth()` there are no checks for zero address and self address.

```javascript
function sendETH(uint256 _amount, address _to) external nonReentrant onlyOwner {
       // --->> NO CHECKS FOR ADDRESS(0) AND SELF ADDRESS 
        (bool success,) = _to.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer Failed");
        _setDeadline();
    }
```

**Impact** 1. For `address(0)` the funds would be lost forever(which are sent to it)
2. For self address there will wastage of gas money

**Proof of Code** In `InheritanceManagertest.t.sol` add the below test functions

```javascript
function test_sendEtherFromOwnertoZeroAddress() public {
        vm.deal(address(im), 10e18);
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        im.sendETH(1e18, address(0));
        assertEq(address(im).balance, 10e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

function test_sendEtherFromOwnertoSelfAddress() public {
        vm.deal(address(im), 10e18);
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        im.sendETH(1e18, address(im));
        assertEq(address(im).balance, 10e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

**Recommended Mitigation** Add the following in your `InheritanceManager::sendEth()` function

```diff
function sendETH(uint256 _amount, address _to) external nonReentrant onlyOwner {
+       require(_to != address(0), "Cannot send to zero address");
+       require(_to != address(this), "Cannot send to self"); 
        (bool success,) = _to.call{value: _amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer Failed");
        _setDeadline();
    }
```

### [M-1] No Zero Address Check in `InheritanceManager::contractInteractions()` Function

**Description:**  
The `InheritanceManager::contractInteractions` function allows the `owner` to make arbitrary low-level calls to **any `_target` address**, including the zero address (`address(0)`)

```javascript
function contractInteractions(address _target, bytes calldata _payload, uint256 _value, bool _storeTarget)
    external
    nonReentrant
    onlyOwner
{
        /// --->> NO CHECKS FOR ZERO TARGET ADDRESS
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_payload);
    require(success, "interaction failed");
    if (_storeTarget) {
        interactions[_target] = data;
    }
}
```
**Impact** 1. Sending ETH to address(0) will result in permanent loss of funds.

2. Low-level calls to the zero address are guaranteed to fail, wasting gas.

**Proof of Code** Add this function in `InheritanceManageTest.t.sol` 

```javascript

function testContractInteractionPassesOnZeroAddress() public {
        vm.deal(address(im), 10e18);
        vm.prank(owner);
        address target = address(0); 
        bytes memory payload = abi.encodeWithSignature("nonExistentFunction()");
        uint256 value = 5e18;
        bool storeTarget = true;
        im.contractInteractions(target, payload, value, storeTarget);
        console.log(address(im).balance);
        console.log(address(target).balance);
    }
```

**Recommended Mitigation** Add the following zero address check in `InheritranceManager::contractInteractions()`

```diff

function contractInteractions(address _target, bytes calldata _payload, uint256 _value, bool _storeTarget)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyOwner
    {
+       require(_target != address(0) , "Revert Zero Address");
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_payload);
        require(success, "interaction failed");
        if (_storeTarget) {
            interactions[_target] = data;
        }
    }
```

### [H-2] InheritanceManager Cannot Receive ETH Directly â€” No `receive()` or `fallback()` Function Defined

**Description:**  
The `InheritanceManager` contract **does not implement a `receive()` or `fallback()` function**, meaning it **cannot directly receive ETH via `transfer()`, `send()`, or `selfdestruct`** calls. This is a critical issue for a contract meant to **hold and manage ETH balances for inheritance purposes**.

**Impact:**

1. **Loss of Funds:** ETH sent to the contract using `transfer()` or `send()` will be **reverted**, preventing funding.
2. **Blocked UX/Functionality:** Common interfaces like Gnosis Safe, UI wallets, or protocols sending ETH may fail.
3. **Breaks Inheritance Logic:** If ETH cannot be received, the core purpose of managing inheritance is undermined.

**Recommended Mitigation:**

No `receive()` or `fallback()` function is present in the contract:

```solidity
// Missing this:
receive() external payable {}

fallback() external payable {}
```

### [H-3] Missing Fund Distribution to Caller in `buyOutEstateNFT()` Function

**Description:**  
In the `InheritanceManager::buyOutEstateNFT()` function, if the caller (`msg.sender`) is one of the beneficiaries, the function **returns early without executing the rest of the code**, particularly the **fund distribution logic**.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < beneficiaries.length; i++) {
    if (msg.sender == beneficiaries[i]) {
        return; // --->> RETURNS EARLY, SKIPPING FUND TRANSFERS
    } else {
        IERC20(assetToPay).safeTransfer(beneficiaries[i], finalAmount / divisor);
    }
    nft.burnEstate(_nftID);
}
```

**Impact:**

1. Loss of User Funds: The caller transfers tokens, but no NFT is burned or distributed.

2. Logic Violation: The entire purpose of buying out the NFT and redistributing the funds is broken.

**Recommended Mitigation:**

```diff
for (uint256 i = 0; i < beneficiaries.length; i++) {
-    if (msg.sender == beneficiaries[i]) {
+    if (msg.sender != benficiaries[i]){   
         return; 
    } else {
        IERC20(assetToPay).safeTransfer(beneficiaries[i], finalAmount / divisor);
    }
    nft.burnEstate(_nftID);
}
}
```

### [H-4] Loss of funds if `owner` removes a beneficiary

**Description:**

If the `owner` removes a `beneficiary` from the `InheritanceManager::beneficiaries[]` array by calling `InheritanceManager::removeBeneficiary()`, a susequent call to `InheritanceManager::inherit()` and `InheritanceManager::withdrawInheritedFunds()` after the 90 day lock, results in a share of the funds being burned.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
Instead of `delete()` keyword use `beneficiaries.pop()`
