## Introduction

BlockBuddy is dedicated to ensuring the security and reliability of decentralized applications by providing thorough and insightful Solidity smart contract audits. This repository serves as a portfolio of my audit work, highlighting the importance of security in the rapidly evolving blockchain space.

## About Me

I am BlockBuddy, a seasoned blockchain developer and security auditor with a passion for Solidity. My experience spans numerous projects where I have identified critical vulnerabilities, suggested best practices, and contributed to the development of more secure smart contracts.

## Audit Methodology

My audit process involves a multi-step approach to ensure comprehensive coverage and in-depth analysis:

1. **Initial Assessment:** Understanding the project’s scope, functionality, and intended behavior.
2. **Code Review:** Systematic examination of the Solidity codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities.
3. **Automated Analysis:** Using industry-standard tools to detect common issues such as reentrancy, overflow, and underflow.
4. **Manual Analysis:** Deep dive into the logic and architecture to uncover complex vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
5. **Reporting:** Detailed documentation of findings, including severity levels, potential impacts, and recommended fixes.
6. **Verification:** Post-fix review to ensure that identified issues have been adequately addressed.
